## Why does Relies-on exist? üõ∏

The main purpose of Relies-on is to identify any workflows that must complete
successfully before another workflow will run.

_(The idea behind this action is similar to Github's
<code><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds">needs</a></code>
but at a workflows scale)._

As an example of a situation where Relies-on comes in handy, let's imagine that you have
two different workflows one called `CI` and another called `CD` assuming the `CD`
workflow will do a critical thing that mustn't be performed only if the latest run of
the `CI` workflow succeeded. One approach to solve this problem is to check the status
of the latest `CI` run manually, but the problem with this approach is the ability to
run the `CD` workflow (doing the critical thing) whether the latest `CI` workflow run
was succeeded or not, which is not totally safe because there is no actual restriction,
therefore Relies-on comes into existence.

## How could aliens use this action? üëΩ

Here's a simple example to get started (assume we have another workflow called `CI`):

```yml
# This is a CD system. It should publish a new release
# if and only if the lastest run of the CI workflow has succeeded.
name: CD

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

jobs:
  check_ci_status:
    name: Check the CI Workflow's Status
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: hadialqattan/relies-on@v1
        with:
          workflow: CI

  # the rest of the jobs...
```

This would terminate the `CD` workflow if the latest `CI` workflow run faild.

**Optional action inputs (arguments):**

```yml
owner:
  The username of the owner of the repository containing the workflow. [default=currect
  repository owner username]

repository:
  The name of the repository containing the workflow. [default=current repository name]

workflow: The name of the workflow that would be checked.

branch:
  The name of the branch where the workflow runs. [default=repository's default branch
  (most likely master or main)]

event: The type of the event that triggers the workflow. [default= ]

exclude_pull_requests: If true pull requests based runs are omitted. [default=true]
# Falsy values: "n", "no", "f", "false", "off", "0"
# Truthy values: "y", "yes", "t", "true", "on", "1"
```
